# Student-performance

This dataset is retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The students' scores are obtained from 2 schools in Portugal. This project aims to find the siginficant predictors that will affect the `G3` score. Firstly, the iterative Mutual Information is performed, and 11 features with non-zero mutual information are stored in the `x_train_clean_11.csv` and `x_test_clean_11.csv` files. Then, Random Forest, LGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost Regressor are trained on the `x_train_clean_11.csv` dataset. The LGBM Regressor achieves the best adjusted R-squared score of 83.72%. Lastly, the `G1_G2_sum`, `failures`, `age`, `Mjob`, and `subject` columns are identified as significant predictors that determine the students' *G3* final scores.
